# Prizes for the teams participating in Airbus Ship Detection Challenge

[Intelinair](https://www.intelinair.com/) Yerevan office announces prizes for the teams in Armenia that successfully participate in [Airbus Ship Detection Challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/) on Kaggle. The challenge is to identify ships from satellite images. All details of the competition are available on Kaggle's website.

### Who is eligible?
The team participating in the contest is eligible to get the prize if:
* The solution is publicly available (e.g. on Github),
* All team members are Armenian citizens or live in Armenia,
* All team members will be available to present the solution in IntelinAir's office upon completion of the competition.

Also please note that no prize will be awarded if the team violates the original [rules of the competition](https://www.kaggle.com/c/airbus-ship-detection/rules) (e.g. multiple accounts, private sharing outside teams etc.).

### What are the prizes?
The prizes will be awarded to the top performing **three teams** that are eligible. The prizes will be awarded only to the teams that will be in the Top 20% of all *active participants* in Kaggle's private leaderboard. The prizes will be higher for the team(s) that are in the Top 10% of all *active participants*.

|   | Top 20%  | Top 10%  |
| ------------ | ------------ | ------------ |
| First place among eligible teams  | $1500 | $3000  |
| Second place among eligible teams  | $1000  | $2000  |
| Third place among eligible teams  | $500  | $1000  |

For example, if five eligible teams appear in Top 20% of all *active participants*, and only one of them will be in Top 10%, then the first team will get $3000, the second team will get $1000 and the third team will get $500.

### How do we define *active participants*?
*Active participant* is defined to be a participant team in the contest that appears in the private leaderboard of the competition and has a better score than the **all-zeros baseline**. Several [Kaggle users showed](https://www.kaggle.com/npatta01/naive-model?scriptVersionId=4853974) that a model that predicts "no ships" for every image scores 0.847 on the public leaderboard (it might be different for the private leaderboard). So *active participant* teams should do better than predicting "no ships" for all images.

In the previous similar contests the number of active participants were [783](https://www.kaggle.com/c/planet-understanding-the-amazon-from-space/leaderboard), [275](https://www.kaggle.com/c/dstl-satellite-imagery-feature-detection/leaderboard) and [702](https://www.kaggle.com/c/data-science-bowl-2018/leaderboard).
